Project Description:
As of now, the University of Colorado at Boulderâ€™s lost and found system is a strange mess of boxes in each building (not guaranteed in any building), each with different policies and overseers. Any items of value are supposed to be turned in to the CU police department and while some buildings have a policy of turning in items to CUPD, not all do. The necessary solution is to create a universal system that connects every building on every Boulder campus to a unified lost and found network. The CU Lost and Found application is a modern solution to lost and found, reconnecting students with their misplaced property in a more dynamic approach. By compiling all information on lost items into one place, this application eliminates the need for students to run around campus trying to relocate their belongings. With this app, students can post when an item is either lost or found.  Postings include a descriptive title, a location tag, and any additional information that may be useful.  All posts are then sorted by location, name, color, and/or date in order to narrow down the search. This one-stop-shop also creates an immutable ledger of items found, who found them, and where they were last seen.

Repo Organization/Structure:
All of the files for our web application are within the "CULostAndFound" folder. The "public" folder contains all files that are live on the webiste. The "functions" folder contains files with the functions used for creating our database. The "archive" folder contains old files, such as different layouts for the add item page, that we want to keep but are not live.

Testing/running code:
All code can be run through different text editors such as Atom, Sublime, etc.
